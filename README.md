# working_on_pc_rosterbot
Selenium python bot that helps to chope slots in the RMG e-roster
6_slots_per_week.py is for the new month; cos they won't allow you to book more than 6 slots. the script will book AM Monday to Saturday AM slots only.
eroster.py will just help to chope slots as they are released
